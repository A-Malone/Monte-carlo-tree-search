        The board is a 2D array where 0 = empty (.), 1 = player 1 (X), 2 = player 2 (O).
        In Othello players alternately place pieces on a square board - each piece played
        has to sandwich opponent pieces between the piece played and pieces already on the 
        board. Sandwiched pieces are flipped.
        This implementation modifies the rules to allow variable sized square boards and
        terminates the game as soon as the player about to move cannot make a move (whereas
        the standard game allows for a pass move).
